    "<p><font face=\"Consolas\">This course will introduce modern concepts and recent \n",
    "trends in data analysis and visualization using the <b>Python</b> programming \n",
    "language. Python (not to be confused with the snake species!) is quickly \n",
    "becoming the most popular programming language for scientific data analysis and \n",
    "visualization. This is, in part, due to the <b>open-source</b> (i.e., free) \n",
    "nature of Python libraries, easy-to-learn syntax, and wide user support \n",
    "community. This course is not intended to teach you all the intricacies \n",
    "associated with the Python programming language. Rather, my goal is to <i>open your world</i> \n",
    "to the powerful capabilities this language (and its corresponding libraries) has \n",
    "to offer in the context of <b>applied problem solving</b> in geographic and \n",
    "atmospheric science. Our field is entering (already in?) an era of \n",
    "&quot;<b>big-data</b>&quot;, where large datasets are becoming the basis for administrative \n",
    "decision making (<i>e.g., data analytics</i>). Thus, skills in data analytics are \n",
    "highly desirable from employers, especially those related to weather and \n",
    "climate applications. I cannot possibly teach you everything there is to know about Python programming as it pertains to geography/meteorology in one semester. There will likely be a lot of web searching for the corrext syntax or answer to a specific coding problem. This is all a part of the normal learning process, so please try not to get frustrated. <i>Patience is key when developing excellent code.</i><br>\n",

    "&quot;graduate&quot; seminar-style courses, but do not expect this to impact course \n",
    "content. We will still examine complex topics and work toward solving applied \n",
    "research problems that have the potential to be submitted to a referred journal \n",
    "for publication. Graduate students (GEOG 790) will have different expectations \n",
    "vs. undergraduate (GEOG 498) students. This may include leading class \n",

    "The first ~half of this course will present topics (elaborated on below) relevant to this seminar. The second ~half will focus on developing specific group projects and applying course techniques on a targeted weather/climate research problem. At the end of the course, each group will present their respective project to an open-department audience and turn in a formatted research paper (details forthcoming).\n",
